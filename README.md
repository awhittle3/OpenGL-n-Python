# OpenGL-n-Python
This repository contains some projects to illustrate use of OpenGL using Python.

One thing that is frustrating when learning OpenGL is the lack of distinction between the "legacy" and "modern" API, and how things sometimes go wrong when the two are mixed.
I have tried to implement the simpler projects using both the old and the new style.
